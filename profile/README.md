1. Curious about the environment, whether or not it's a computing environment or a real-life environment.
2. Open to learning new applications, skills, and ways to accomplish tasks.
3. Interested in saving time by using software to do work, play, or live life more efficiently.

Everything is done in the open by default with transparency in mind.
